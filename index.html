  <Header> <h2> A Bit About Curry </h2> </header>
     <p1>Curry is the word used to describe a wide variety of dishes originating in parts of Asia. Curry is often characterised by an explosion of flavours created by a variety of different spices. Smoe common combinations include turmeric, cumin and chilli, or lime, coriander and chilli.
    </p1>
    <p2> At my flat, we commonly cook indian and thai curries-generally vegetarian. The favourite is a Palak Paneer, from scratch. This delicious curry is made from pureed spinach and a type of indian cottage cheese called Paneer. Paneer is relatively easy to make and tastes best when fresh.

  <header><h2> Flatmates </h2> </header>
<p1> In New Zealand, sharing a house with others is a very common lifestyle for young people. It's a great way to experience independance, forge close bonds and also teaches patience and resilience. Living in large flatting situations is always fun, but without good systems in place it can get a little hectic. Mutual respect for your flatmates is key. For example, it can be annoying if you are trying to code on a Friday night but your flatmates keep pestering you because they've had too much beer and they want you to cook a curry for them. However, the situation can be mitigated but simply cooking the curry and continuing your work in your room. Your name was on the roster anyway...
</p1>
<p2> The most annoying thing about flatting is that people are not very good at cleaning up after themselves. I have found this problem to have been less major over time. I hypothesis that it is because as people get older, they tend to party less and clean more. In my opinion the following correlations are relevant: 1. get older. 2. Party less. 3. Spend your previously allocated money on overpriced organics. 4. Get sick of living in pigstye, clean more.
