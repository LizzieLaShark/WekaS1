Allow users to specify text size in an easily comprehensive way

Make sure any search engines are as resilient as possible to typos and user errors

Don't use PDF's unless the content is explicitely for printing

Make sure that once the user has clicked on a link, it's colour changes. Very confusing otherwise!

Format text properly so that it is easy to read. Make good use of the following:
  -Bullet points
  -subheadings
  -bolded text
  -dont use language that makes you sound like your tooting your own horn too much.
  -keep it simple
  -make sure the most important things are at the top of the text. 'inverted pyramid'
  
  Be thoughtful about what you call your page names, those first few words are important and the way you word them will effect usability
  
  Get rid of stuff that might look like and ad. People just ignore them.
  
  Stick to design conventions. It makes people feel more comfortable.
  
  Dont set your links to open up in new windows-it's annoying. Also means the user cant use the 'back' button.
  
  Make sure the important info that the user wants is there and is easy to access.
